Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game server-client project with SSL encryption. This project allows you to play Tic Tac Toe with friends over a secure SSL connection.

## Instructions 

Before running the server or client code, please make sure you have obtained the SSL certificate(.crt) and private key(.key). These files are necessary for establishing a secure connection between the server and the clients.

Run server.py first and then run client1.py and client2.py
The 2 clients can then enjoy the game.

# Note:
->The clients must have the path to the certificate and the server must have the path to both certificate as well as the key.

->The server and clients must be connected to the same WiFi.

->Fill in the ip address of the server only.

->To know the ip address of the server device, open the terminal and type "ipconfig" (for windows) or "ifconfig" (for linux). You will find the ip address in LAN WiFi (IPv4 address).
