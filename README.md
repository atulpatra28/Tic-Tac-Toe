Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game server-client project with SSL encryption. This project allows you to play Tic Tac Toe with friends over a secure SSL connection.

## Instructions 

Before running the server or client code, please make sure you have obtained the SSL certificate(.crt) and private key(.key). These files are necessary for establishing a secure connection between the server and the clients.

Run server.py first and then run client1.py and client2.py
The 2 clients can then enjoy the game.

# Note:
->The clients must have the path to the certificate and the server must have the path to both certificate as well as the key.

->Fill in the ip address of the server only.
